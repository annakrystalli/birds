#### Corrections

- Two clutch size variables in **D6**, ```clutch.size``` and ```clutch.size.akif```. ```clutch.size.akif``` separated into dataset **D6a** to be added to array.
- Errors in **D6** ```clutch.size.akif``` for *Zonotrichia_leucophrys*. Clutch size recorded as ```26``` when all other clutch size records were around ```4.5```. Corrected to ```4.5```
